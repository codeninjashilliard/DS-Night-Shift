# DS-Night-Shift
A game where you are the character. Inspired by The watchtower experience, and night shift experience. Both are Roblox games that inspired me to make this game. In a fantasy like forest with a big clearing where the game takes place. The point is to do tasks and get your payment scattered around over. Once all tasks are done, then it is game over.
